        <h1 class="minortitle">Personal Info</h1>
    I am currently a student at NAIT studying computer engineering, aspiring to eventually merge my experience from the program with the medical field, following in my family's footsteps. I enjoy working with both hardware and software, however I have a better understanding of the software side of things. My dream study is biomedical engineering, though before I pursue this, I wish to expand my knowledge of the IT industry and see what other interesting fields lie out there.

       <p style="color: white; text-align: left;"><span style="color:#48C9F0">Martial Arts:</span>Starting at the age of 5 I have been practicing filipino/indonesian martial arts, though only truly practicing regularly by about the age of 12. The art I practice with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/3storms/">Three Storms Martial Arts</a> is Arnis, also known as Kali or Eskrima/Escrima</p>

       <p style="color: white; text-align: left;"><span style="color:#48C9F0">3D Printing:</span>I got my first 3D Printer in 2018 and from then on I have had so much fun with it. I am for the most part self taught and have had to battle through error codes on error codes and now i feel like I have a solid grasp of my printer. Along with the printer I have taught my self the basics of CAD to make things i can use in day to day life</p>
